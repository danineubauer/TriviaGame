# Purpose
\
This is the fifth homework assignment in the UC Berkeley Coding BootCamp (Week fifth) with the purpose of learning to use timers to switch between visuals and text displays. \ 

In this assignment, I created a short trivia game which asks the user a number of questions, sets a timer which counts the seconds backwards and waits for the user to choose an answer. When the user chooses an answer, the program displays whether the user answered correctly or not or if the time runs out, it shows that the user ran out of time. If the user answers correctly, they get a point added to their score. At the end of the game, the computer displays the user's total score. \
